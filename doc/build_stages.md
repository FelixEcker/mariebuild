# Mariebuild Building Stages
The build stages are listed in order of execution. If any build stage fails,
the build is aborted.

## Prepare
The "prepare" build stage is run first, it searches for the `prepare` section
within the `.scripts` sector. If found, this script is executed.

## Prepare Mode
The "prepare mode" build stage runs a prepare script, which is associated to
the build mode by name.

## Compile
The "compile" build stage runs for every entry within the `.config/mariebuild/files`
field. In this stage the field `file` is made available which holds the entry of the 
`files` field currently being compiled.
For each file, the field `.config/mariebuild/comp_cmd` is run as a command, 
which should be used to compile the seperate files.

## Finalize
The "finalize" build stage is, as the name implies, the final build stage. This stage
is commonly used for linking object files generated by the "compile" stage.
This stage runs the `.config/mariebuild/finalize_cmd` once as a command.
