## File structure
Mariebuild utilises the MCFG/2 format for its build files. These are structured into sectors, then sections, then fields. Fields may only be declared within sections, which intern can only be declared within sectors.

Mariebuild requires 3 sectors:
1. config
2. targets
3. c_rules

For information about targets and c_rules, see their respective files within the documentation.

Within the config sector, mariebuild expects a mariebuild section containing a list of targets which should be available through the command line. A Default target can also be declared here.
Additionally the default build type for each rule can also be defined there.

Example:
```mcfg2
sector config
  section mariebuild
    ; build_type can either be incremental or full
    str build_type 'incremental'

    list str targets 'clean', 'debug', 'release'
    str default 'debug'
  end
end
```
